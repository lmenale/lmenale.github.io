<h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
<p>I am Luigi Menale, a Senior Engineering Manager based in Munich, Germany, with extensive experience in the fields of automotive, defense, and IT. I have over a decade of active experience in managing the full life cycle of technical projects, starting from inception all the way to delivery. Having handled various responsibilities for more than a decade in engineering management, software development, and project leadership, I have mentored and led cross-functional teams spread across various sites toward achieving peak productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>My delivery is project-focused and results-driven, with a keen eye for process analysis to realize areas of growth and development that may not be so apparent. I am known for my effective communication and problem-solving abilities, allowing coordination between internal and external stakeholders involved in the project. This has enabled me to realize continuous improvement while increasing the contribution margins considerably in the organizations I have worked for.</p>
<p>Working in a variety of environments, ranging from classic software development to modern ones like data science and Web3, I managed to get on board and adapt continuously, based on my strong technical background in programming languages like C++, Rust, Python, and Java; tools like Git, Jenkins, and Docker. My professional potential is complemented by multi-lingual proficiency in Italian, English, and German, enabling the establishment of good relations and communication with multinational groups of people.</p>
<p>I am passionate about leading through times of change and innovation, ready to tackle fresh challenges and push the envelope of technology to deliver outstanding results. Whether optimizing existing frameworks or pioneering new projects, the aim will always go back to leading teams that make lasting impressions on the industry and the technology landscape.</p>
<p>Connect with me as we explore and shape the future of technology together.</p>
