I am Luigi Menale, a Senior Engineering Manager based in Munich, Germany, with a dynamic career in the automotive, defense, and IT sectors. I bring over a decade of experience overseeing the full lifecycle of technical projects, from inception to delivery. My expertise spans engineering management, software development, and project leadership, where I have successfully mentored and led cross-functional teams across multiple sites to ensure peak productivity and efficiency.

My approach is project-focused and results-oriented, and I have a knack for analyzing processes to identify opportunities for growth and improvement. I am known for my skilled communication and ability to think through complex problems, facilitating collaboration between internal and external project stakeholders. This has allowed me to drive continuous improvement and significantly increase the contribution margins within the organizations I have worked with.

Having worked in diverse environments, from traditional software development to cutting-edge sectors like data science and Web3, I have continuously adapted and thrived, leveraging my strong technical background in programming languages such as C++, Rust, Python, and Java, and tools like Git, Jenkins, and Docker. My multi-lingual proficiency in Italian, English, and German complements my professional capabilities, enabling effective communication and relationship-building in multinational settings.

I am passionate about leading through change and innovation, ready to tackle new challenges and push the boundaries of technology to deliver exceptional results. Whether optimizing existing frameworks or pioneering new projects, my goal is to lead teams that leave a lasting impact on the industry and technology landscape.
